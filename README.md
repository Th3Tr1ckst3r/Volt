# Volt

Volt is a free, secure, and interactive AES256-bit encryption program. This is not yet ready for production use, and ALOT needs to be tested first.

# Demo

![Demo]()

# Installation

More documentation coming soon.

# Requirements

Requirements for this project were carefully thought out before being included. I designed Volt to be light-weight, and fully-functional.
As such, almost all imports are already included in your default Python3 installation. A few are not included, and they will be listed down below:

```Python
pip install Gooey
pip install Cryptography
```
